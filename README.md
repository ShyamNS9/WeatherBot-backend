# WeatherBot-backend

This is the repo where I will be adding all the RASA part of the POC named WeatherBot which I'm building during my internship at smartSense to get the hand-on with the RASA framework to build chatbots. Basically we can say that this repo is the backend part, will act as a backend for my POC. The frontend part will be added in the another repo.
